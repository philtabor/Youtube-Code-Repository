    "Soft Actor Critic (SAC) is an algorithm that optimizes a stochastic policy in an off-policy way, <font color=red>forming a bridge between stochastic policy optimization and DDPG-style approaches</font>. It isn't a direct successor to TD3 (having been published roughly concurrently), but it incorporates the clipped double-Q trick, and due to the inherent stochasticity of the policy in SAC, it also winds up benefiting from something like target policy smoothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "A central feature of SAC is **entropy regularization.** <font color=red>The policy is trained to maximize a trade-off between expected return and `entropy`, a measure of randomness in the policy</font>. This has a close connection to the exploration-exploitation trade-off: increasing entropy results in more exploration, which can accelerate learning later on. It can also prevent the policy from prematurely converging to a bad local optimum. \n",

    "SAC concurrently learns a policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$ and two Q-functions $Q_{\\phi_1}, Q_{\\phi_2}$. There are two variants of SAC that are currently standard: one that uses a fixed entropy regularization coefficient $\\alpha$, and another that enforces an entropy constraint by varying $\\alpha$ over the course of training. For simplicity, Spinning Up makes use of the version with a fixed entropy regularization coefficient, but the entropy-constrained variant is generally preferred by practitioners.\n",

    "\n",
    "2) Like in TD3, the shared target is computed using target Q-networks, and the target Q-networks are obtained by polyak averaging the Q-network parameters over the course of training.\n",

    "3) Like in TD3, the shared target makes use of the **clipped double-Q** trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's different?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Unlike in TD3, the target also includes a term that comes from SAC's use of entropy regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Unlike in TD3, <font color = red>the next-state actions used in the target come from the **current policy** instead of a target policy</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Unlike in TD3, there is no explicit target policy smoothing. TD3 trains a deterministic policy, and so it accomplishes smoothing by adding random noise to the next-state actions. SAC trains a stochastic policy, and so the noise from that stochasticity is sufficient to get a similar effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we give the final form of the Q-loss, letâ€™s take a moment to discuss how the contribution from entropy regularization comes in. We'll start by taking our recursive Bellman equation for the entropy-regularized $Q^{\\pi}$ from earlier, and rewriting it a little bit by using the definition of entropy:\n",

It also changes the distribution: before the $\\tanh$ the SAC policy is a factored Gaussian like the other algorithms' policies, but after the $\\tanh$ it is not. (You can still compute the log-probabilities of actions in closed form, though: see the paper appendix for details.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. The way standard deviations are parameterized.** In VPG, TRPO, and PPO, we represent the log std devs with state-independent parameter vectors.

(Can you think of why? Or better yet: run an experiment to verify?)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reparameterization trick allows us to rewrite the expectation over actions (which contains a pain point: the distribution depends on the policy parameters) into an expectation over noise (which removes the pain point: the distribution now has no dependence on parameters):\n",
