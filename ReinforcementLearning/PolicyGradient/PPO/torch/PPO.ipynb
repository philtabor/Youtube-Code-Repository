    "PPO is motivated by the same question as TRPO: how can we take the biggest possible improvement step on a policy using the data we currently have, without stepping so far that we accidentally cause performance collapse? Where TRPO tries to solve this problem with a complex second-order method, <span style=\"color:red\">PPO is a family of first-order methods that use a few other tricks to keep new policies close to old.</span> PPO methods are significantly simpler to implement, and empirically seem to perform at least as well as TRPO.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary variants of PPO: PPO-Penalty and PPO-Clip. \n",
    "\n",
    "**PPO-Penalty** approximately solves a KL-constrained update like TRPO, but penalizes the KL-divergence in the objective function instead of making it a hard constraint, and automatically adjusts the penalty coefficient over the course of training so that it's scaled appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "**<span style=\"color:red\">PPO-Clip</span>** doesn't have a KL-divergence term in the objective and doesn't have a constraint at all. Instead relies on specialized clipping in the objective function to remove incentives for the new policy to get far from the old policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll focus only on PPO-Clip (the primary variant used at OpenAI)."

    "PPO trains a stochastic policy in an on-policy way. This means that it explores by sampling actions according to the latest version of its stochastic policy. The amount of randomness in action selection depends on both initial conditions and the training procedure. Over the course of training, the policy typically becomes progressively less random, as the update rule encourages it to exploit rewards that it has already found. This may cause the policy to get trapped in local optima."
